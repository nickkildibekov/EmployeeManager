# UI/UX Guidelines 

- Forms: simple, intuitive, real-time validation feedback, good placeholders, tooltips on hover, clear error messages (red + icon)
- Layout: use modern grid/flex, good spacing/padding, visual hierarchy
- Buttons: large enough, clear CTAs, hover/focus states
- Design: minimalistic, clean, modern look suitable for demo (light/dark theme support if possible)
- Mobile-friendly: everything must look good on phones (test with dev tools)
