# Angular 18+ Best Practices

- Use standalone components (no NgModules whenever possible)
- Prefer reactive forms over template-driven
- Avoid 'any' type — use 'unknown' or proper interfaces
- Strict typing everywhere: inputs, outputs, services, http responses
- Signals for local/component state where appropriate
- Follow Angular style guide: kebab-case for selectors/files, meaningful names
- Mobile-first responsive design + media queries
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA where needed, keyboard navigation
- Styling: prefer Tailwind CSS or Angular Material (choose one consistently)
